    "text": "Introduction\nHello 👋 and welcome! The purpose of this website is to provide workshop materials for the “Spatial Analysis and Statistical Modeling with R and spmodel” workshop at the 2024 Society for Freshwater Science Conference in Philadelphia, PA, USA. To view the workshop’s accompanying workbook, visit here. To download the workshop’s slides, visit here. Slides are downloaded by clicking the “Download raw file” button via the ellipsis or downward arrow symbol on the right side of the screen.\nIt is our hope that this workshop will provide attendees with the conceptual and practical knowledge to incorporate geospatial analyses into their R workflow to improve the interpretation of spatial data. In particular, this workshop will focus on the R package spmodel.\nWhat is spmodel? The spmodel R package (Dumelle, Higham, and Ver Hoef 2023) can be used to fit, summarize, and predict for a variety of spatial statistical models. Some of the things that spmodel can do include:\nWhy use spmodel? There are many great spatial modeling packages in R. A few reasons to use spmodel for spatial analysis are that:\nThroughout the rest of these materials, we introduce spmodel through a few applied examples. We connect basic summary output with the spatial linear model for both point-referenced and areal (lattice) data. We discuss prediction and generalized linear spatial models for response variables whose distribution is not Gaussian. Along the way, we mention a few other advanced spmodel features. Then we show how to use spmodel to analyze several real freshwater data sets.\nWorkshop Summary. The spmodel R package can be used to fit, summarize, and predict for a variety of spatial statistical models for both point-referenced and areal spatial data. What distinguishes spmodel from many other R packages for modeling spatial data is (1) a syntactic structure similar to the syntactic structure of base R functions lm() and glm() that makes spmodel relatively easy to learn, (2) the breadth of options that give the user a high amount of control over the model being fit, and (3) compatibility with other modern R packages like broom and sf. By the end of this workshop, participants can expect to be able to use spmodel to fit spatial linear models for point-referenced and areal (lattice) data, make predictions for unobserved spatial locations, fit anisotropic models for point-referenced data, fit spatial models with additional non-spatial random effects, fit generalized linear models for spatial data, and use big data methods to analyze large spatial data sets. More information on spmodel can be found on our website at https://usepa.github.io/spmodel/."

    "text": "6.1 Why StreamCat/LakeCat?\nThe examples of watershed delineation and metric extraction we covered thus far have been for relatively small systems. The process to generate watershed information can be far more complicated for large watersheds, when the desired metrics are needed at many sites across a large geographic extent, or when data layers that are not served as part of other R packages.\nFor these reasons, we developed the StreamCat and LakeCat datasets. StreamCat uses the medium resolution NHPlus (version 2.1) as its geospatial framework to provide watershed summaries of several hundred metrics for all accumulative watersheds in the NHDPlus - about 2.6 million stream segments. Likewise, LakeCat provides watershed metrics for close to 400,000 lakes across the conterminous U.S. as well.\nBoth datasets are now accessible through the StreamCatTools package."

    "section": "\n6.3 Accessing LakeCat",
    "text": "6.3 Accessing LakeCat\nLike StreamCat, LakeCat makes local catchment and watershed metrics available for lakes across the lower 48 states. Like StreamCat, the metrics were developed from a framework of pre-staged lake-catchments that allowed for accumulation of results, even when lakes are nested.\nThe challenge of watershed delineation and extraction of data is even greater than for lakes than streams. There are no online services that do this. Therefore, LakeCat is one of the only ways to get watershed metrics for lakes (however, see LAGOS-NE and LAGOS-US GEO).\n As with StreamCat, the Metrics and Definitions page is the best way to examine which variables are available in LakeCat. Currently, fewer variables are available in LakeCat than StreamCat, mainly due to the fact that riparian buffers were not included as an “AOI” for lakes.\nThe R function to access LakeCat data was designed to parallel StreamCat functions. In this example, we:\n\nDefine a sf object of a sample point at Pelican Lake, WI.\nObtain the lake waterbody polygon.\nExtract the COMID (unique ID) to query LakeCat.\nPull data on mean watershed elevation, calcium oxide content of the geology, % sand and organic matter content of soils, and % of the watershed composed of deciduous forest.\n\n\nlibrary(nhdplusTools)\n\n# Pelican Lake, WI\nlatitude <- 45.502840\nlongitude <- -89.198694\n\npelican_pt <- data.frame(site_name = 'Pelican Lake',\n                         latitude = latitude,\n                         longitude = longitude) %>% \n  st_as_sf(coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'), crs = 4326)\n\npelican_lake <- nhdplusTools::get_waterbodies(pelican_pt) \n\ncomid <- pelican_lake %>% \n  pull(comid)\n\nlc_get_data(metric = 'elev, cao, sand, om, pctdecid2019',\n            aoi = 'watershed',\n            comid = comid)\n#> # A tibble: 1 × 7\n#>       COMID WSAREASQKM SANDWS ELEVWS CAOWS PCTDECID2019WS  OMWS\n#>       <dbl>      <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>          <dbl> <dbl>\n#> 1 167120863       41.0   59.6   491.  4.81           14.7  16.7\n\nAt this time, the ability to query LakeCat based on geography, such as state, county, or hydrologic region is still forthcoming. However, it is possible to query based on multiple COMIDs. In this code, we will create a 100Km buffer around pelican lake, acces those lakes via nhdplusTools, and access LakeCat data for these lakes. We’ll then map lakes and color them by watershed area and compare lake areas with watershed areas.\n\n# 100km buffer to pelican point\npelican_buffer <- \n  pelican_pt %>% \n  st_buffer(10000)\n\npelican_neighbors <- nhdplusTools::get_waterbodies(pelican_buffer) %>% \n  filter(ftype == 'LakePond') %>% \n  rename(COMID = comid)\n\ncomids <- pelican_neighbors %>% \n  pull(COMID)\n\nlc_data <- lc_get_data(metric = 'elev, cao, sand, om, pctdecid2019',\n                       aoi = 'watershed',\n                       comid = comids) \n\npelican_neighbors <- \n  pelican_neighbors %>% \n  left_join(lc_data, join_by('COMID'))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = pelican_neighbors, \n          aes(fill = WSAREASQKM)) + \n  geom_sf(data = pelican_buffer,\n          color = 'red',\n          fill = NA) + \n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = pelican_neighbors,\n             aes(x = WSAREASQKM, \n                 y = areasqkm), \n             size = 4, alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  xlab('Watershed Area (Km2)') +\n  scale_y_log10() +\n  ylab('Lake Area (Km2)') +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nIn the next sections, we will put what we have learned about GIS in R together with the spmodel package to model two types of data. First, we will model the presence/absence of a damselfly genus (Argia) in the northeastern U.S. streams. We’ll access Argia presences/absences via another R package that was recently released called finsyncR. In the second example, we will model the specific conductivity of lakes in several midwestern states."

    "section": "\n1.1 The Spatial Linear Model",
    "text": "1.1 The Spatial Linear Model\n\n1.1.1 Reviewing the Nonspatial Linear Model\nBefore we describe the spatial linear model, we review nonspatial linear models, which many of us are already familiar with (whether we realize it or not). They incredibly flexible statistical tools that encompass all sorts of model types. In fact, multiple linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), splines, polynomial regression, additive models, and mixed effect models are all linear models! Linear models are designed to relate a response variable (i.e., dependent variable) to one or more explanatory variables (i.e., independent variable, predictor variable, covariate) while accounting for random error. More formally, the linear model may be written (for a single observation) as \\[\n\\begin{split} \\text{y} & = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_k + \\epsilon \\\\\ni & = 1, 2, \\dots, k\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{y}\\) is the value of the response variable, \\(\\beta_0\\) is the overall intercept, \\(\\beta_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th fixed effect (sometimes called a “slope”) parameter, which captures the average effect on \\(\\text{y}\\) resulting from a one-unit increase in \\(x_i\\), the value of the \\(i\\)th (of \\(k\\)) explanatory variable, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is random error. Generalizing this model to \\(n\\) distinct observations yields \\[\n\\begin{split} \\text{y}_j & = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1, j} + \\beta_2 x_{2, j} + \\dots + \\beta_k x_{k, j} + \\epsilon_j \\\\\ni & = 1, 2, \\dots, k \\\\\nj & = 1, 2, \\dots, n\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.2}\\] where the model terms from Equation 1.1 are now indexed via a subscript \\(j\\) that ranges from one to \\(n\\), the sample size. The index \\(i\\) still ranges from one to \\(k\\), the number of explanatory variables. Linear models are commonly fit in R using the lm() function.\nThe model in Equation 1.2 is sometimes written in matrix notation instead of index notation. Let\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\text{y}_1 \\\\\n  \\text{y}_2 \\\\\n  \\vdots \\\\\n  \\text{y}_j \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\mathbf{X} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & x_{1, 1} & x_{1, 2} & \\dots & x_{1, k} \\\\\n1 & x_{2, 1} & x_{2, 2} & \\dots & x_{2, k} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & x_{n, 1} & x_{n, 2} & \\dots & x_{n, k} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\beta_0 \\\\\n\\beta_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\beta_k\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\text{ and }\n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\epsilon_0 \\\\\n\\epsilon_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\epsilon_j\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\] where for a sample size \\(n\\), \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the \\(n \\times 1\\) column vector of response variables, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the \\(n \\times p\\) matrix of explanatory variables (sometimes called the “design” or “model” matrix), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is the \\(p \\times 1\\) column vector of fixed effects, and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) is the \\(n \\times 1\\) column vector of random errors.\nThen Equation 1.2 in matrix notation is written as \\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}.\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nThere are typically a few assumptions inherent in models built using Equation 1.3. First, we typically assume that \\(\\text{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\mathbf{0}\\), where \\(\\text{E}(\\cdot)\\) denotes expectation. Less formally, this means that the average of all random errors is zero. Second, we typically assume \\(\\text{Cov}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\sigma^2_\\epsilon \\mathbf{I}\\), where \\(\\text{Cov}(\\cdot)\\) denotes covariance, \\(\\sigma^2_\\epsilon\\) denotes a variance parameter, and \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) denotes the identity matrix. Less formally, this means that each random error is independent of other random errors (i.e., we gain no information about observation two’s random error by knowing observation one’s random error). Moreover, we also usually assume these random errors are normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Modeling Misconceptions\n\n\n\nMisconception one: That linear models can only be used if there are linear relationships between a response variable and an explanatory variable – this is untrue! Linear models can be constructed to handle nonlinear relationships by leveraging special tools like splines, polynomial regression, and additive models.\nMisconception two: That linear models can only be used if the response variable is normally distributed – this is untrue! Our normality assumption is on the random errors, not the response itself (this is a very important point). We can investigate the plausibility of normally distributed random errors by investigating the residuals of a model (our best guess at these random errors).\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Introducing the Spatial Linear Model\nAs mentioned previously, nonspatial linear models are very flexible tools that can capture all sorts of interesting processes. Unfortunately, they do assume that random errors are independent of one another, often unreasonable for spatial data as observations tend to be correlated in space. Ignoring this spatial dependence and fitting nonspatial linear models generally leads to invalid fixed effect inference and poor predictions. Spatial linear models leverage spatial dependence in the random error structure of a linear model, creating models that more accurately reflect the spatial process in study and perform substantially better than nonspatial linear models. Fortunately, incorporating spatial dependence is straightforward using spmodel, which we discuss shortly.\nMore formally, we accommodate spatial dependence in linear models by adding an \\(n \\times 1\\) spatial random effect, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\), to Equation 1.3, yielding the model\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon},\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nwhere \\(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\) is independent of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\), \\(\\text{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}) = \\mathbf{0}\\), \\(\\text{Cov}(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}) = \\sigma^2_\\tau \\mathbf{R}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is a matrix that determines the spatial dependence structure in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and depends on a range parameter, \\(\\phi\\), which controls the behavior of the spatial covariance as a function of distance. We discuss \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) in more detail shortly. The parameter \\(\\sigma^2_\\tau\\) is called the spatially dependent random error variance or partial sill. The parameter \\(\\sigma^2_\\epsilon\\) is called the spatially independent random error variance or nugget. These two variance parameters are henceforth more intuitively written as \\(\\sigma^2_{de}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{ie}\\), respectively. The covariance of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is denoted \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) and given by \\(\\sigma^2_{de} \\mathbf{R} + \\sigma^2_{ie} \\mathbf{I}\\). The parameters that compose this covariance are contained in the vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), which is called the covariance parameter vector.\nEquation 1.4 is called the spatial linear model. The spatial linear model applies to both point-referenced and areal (i.e., lattice) data. Spatial data are point-referenced when the elements in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) are observed at point-locations indexed by x-coordinates and y-coordinates on a spatially continuous surface with an infinite number of locations. For example, consider sampling soil at any point-location in a field. Spatial data are areal when the elements in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) are observed as part of a finite network of polygons whose connections are indexed by a neighborhood structure. For example, the polygons may represent states in a country who are neighbors if they share at least one boundary.\n\n1.1.3 Modeling Covariance in the Spatial Linear Model\nA primary way in which the model in Equation 1.4 differs for point-referenced and areal data is the way in which \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) in \\(\\text{Cov}(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}) = \\sigma^2_{de} \\mathbf{R}\\) is modeled. For point-referenced data, the \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) matrix is generally constructed using the Euclidean distance between spatial locations. For example, the exponential spatial covariance function generates an \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) matrix given by\n\\[\n\\mathbf{R} = \\exp(-\\mathbf{H} / \\phi),\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is a matrix of Euclidean distances among observations and \\(\\phi\\) is the range parameter. Some spatial covariance functions have an extra parameter – one example is the Matérn covariance. Spatial models for point-referenced data are fit in spmodel using the splm() function.\nOn the other hand, \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) for areal data is often constructed from how the areal polygons are oriented in space. Commonly, a neighborhood structure is used to construct \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), where two observations are considered to be “neighbors” if they share a common boundary. In the simultaneous auto-regressive (SAR) model,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{R} = [(\\mathbf{I} - \\phi \\mathbf{W}) (\\mathbf{I} - \\phi \\mathbf{W}^\\top)]^{-1}\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the identity matrix and \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) is a weight matrix that describes the neighborhood structure among observations. A popular neighborhood structure is queen contiguity, in which two polygons are neighbors if they share a boundary. It is important to clarify that observations are not considered neighbors with themselves. Spatial models for areal data are fit in spmodel using the spautor() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nNavigate to the Help file for splm by running ?splm or by visiting this link and scroll down to “Details.” Examine the spatial linear model description in the Help file and relate some of the syntax used to the syntax in Equation 1.4 and Equation 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe form of the spatial linear model (\\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\)) is the same in the Help file as the form in Equation Equation 1.4. In the help file, \\(de\\) refers to \\(\\sigma^2_{de}\\), \\(ie\\) refers to \\(\\sigma^2_{ie}\\), and \\(range\\) refers to \\(\\phi\\). Finally, in the help file \\(h\\) refers to distance between observations while, in Equation 1.5, \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) refers to a matrix of these distances for all pairs of observations."

We can view the first few rows of moss by running\n\nmoss\n#> Simple feature collection with 365 features and 7 fields\n#> Geometry type: POINT\n#> Dimension:     XY\n#> Bounding box:  xmin: -445884.1 ymin: 1929616 xmax: -383656.8 ymax: 2061414\n#> Projected CRS: NAD83 / Alaska Albers\n#> # A tibble: 365 × 8\n#>    sample field_dup lab_rep year  sideroad log_dist2road log_Zn\n#>    <fct>  <fct>     <fct>   <fct> <fct>            <dbl>  <dbl>\n#>  1 001PR  1         1       2001  N                 2.68   7.33\n#>  2 001PR  1         2       2001  N                 2.68   7.38\n#>  3 002PR  1         1       2001  N                 2.54   7.58\n#>  4 003PR  1         1       2001  N                 2.97   7.63\n#>  5 004PR  1         1       2001  N                 2.72   7.26\n#>  6 005PR  1         1       2001  N                 2.76   7.65\n#>  7 006PR  1         1       2001  S                 2.30   7.59\n#>  8 007PR  1         1       2001  N                 2.78   7.16\n#>  9 008PR  1         1       2001  N                 2.93   7.19\n#> 10 009PR  1         1       2001  N                 2.79   8.07\n#> # ℹ 355 more rows\n#> # ℹ 1 more variable: geometry <POINT [m]>\n\nMore information about moss can be found by running help(\"moss\", \"spmodel\").\nOur goal is to model the distribution of log zinc concentration (log_Zn) using a spatial linear model. We can visualize the distribution of log zinc concentration (log_Zn) in moss by running\n\nggplot(moss, aes(color = log_Zn)) +\n  geom_sf(size = 2) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-163, -164, length.out = 2)) +\n  theme_gray(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\nDistribution of log zinc concentration in the moss data.\n\n\n\n\nAn important predictor variable may be the log of the distance to the haul road, log_dist2road, which is measured in meters. Later we use spmodel to fit a spatial linear model with with log_Zn as the response and log_dist2road as a predictor.\n\n1.2.2 splm() Syntax and Output Interpretation\nThe splm() function shares similar syntactic structure with the lm() function used to fit linear models without spatial dependence (Equation 1.3). splm() generally requires at least three arguments\n\n\nformula: a formula that describes the relationship between the response variable (\\(\\mathbf{y}\\)) and explanatory variables (\\(\\mathbf{X}\\))\n\n\nformula in splm() is the same as formula in lm()\n\n\n\n\ndata: a data.frame or sf object that contains the response variable, explanatory variables, and spatial information.\n\nspcov_type: the spatial covariance type (\"exponential\", \"matern\", \"spherical\", etc)\n\nThere are 17 different types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf data is an sf object, then spatial information is stored in the object’s geometry. However, if data is a data.frame or tibble (a special data.frame), then the names of the variables that represent the x-coordinates and y-coordinates must also be provided as two additional arguments via xcoord and ycoord.\n\n\nWe fit a spatial linear model regressing log zinc concentration (log_Zn) on log distance to a haul road (log_dist2road) using an exponential spatial covariance function by running\n\nspmod <- splm(formula = log_Zn ~ log_dist2road, data = moss,\n              spcov_type = \"exponential\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe estimation method in splm() is specified by estmethod. The default estimation method is restricted maximum likelihood (\"reml\"). Additional options include maximum likelihood \"ml\", semivariogram-based composite likelihood (\"sv-cl\") (Curriero and Lele 1999), and semivariogram-based weighted least squares (\"sv-wls\") (Cressie 1985). When the estimation method is semivariogram-based weighted least squares, the weights are specified by weights with a default of Cressie weights (“cressie\").\n\n\nWe summarize the model fit by running\n\nsummary(spmod)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> splm(formula = log_Zn ~ log_dist2road, data = moss, spcov_type = \"exponential\")\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n#> -2.6801 -1.3606 -0.8103 -0.2485  1.1298 \n#> \n#> Coefficients (fixed):\n#>               Estimate Std.

From this table, we notice there is evidence that mean log zinc concentration significantly decreases with distance from the haul road (p-value < 2e-16).\nWe can relate some of the components in the summary output to the model in Equation 1.4:\n\nThe values in the Estimate column of the Coefficients (fixed) table form \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}\\), an estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\).\nThe de value of 0.36 in the Coefficients (exponential spatial covariance) table is \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_{de}\\), which is an estimate of \\(\\sigma^2_{de}\\), the variance of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\) (commonly called the partial sill).\nThe ie value of 0.079 in the Coefficients (exponential spatial covariance) table is \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_{ie}\\), which is an estimate of \\(\\sigma^2_{ie}\\), the variance of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) (commonly called the nugget).\nThe range value of 8,237 in the Coefficients (exponential spatial covariance) table is \\(\\hat{\\phi}\\), which is an estimate of \\(\\phi\\) (recall \\(\\phi\\) is the range parameter in Equation 1.5 that controls the behavior of the spatial covariance as a function of distance).\n\nThe pseudo R-squared emulates the R-squared from nonspatial linear models, quantifying the proportion of variability in the model explained by the fixed effects. Via varcomp(), we can identify how much variability is attributed to distinct parts of the model:\n\nvarcomp(spmod)\n#> # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#>   varcomp            proportion\n#>   <chr>                   <dbl>\n#> 1 Covariates (PR-sq)     0.683 \n#> 2 de                     0.260 \n#> 3 ie                     0.0571\n\nWe see most of the variability is explained by the fixed effects (pseudo R-squared) and the spatially dependent random error (de), while little variability is independent (ie).\nThe summary() output, while useful, is printed to the R console and not easy to manipulate. The tidy() function turns the coefficient table into a tibble (i.e., a special data.frame) that is easy to manipulate. We tidy the fixed effects by running\n\ntidy(spmod)\n#> # A tibble: 2 × 5\n#>   term          estimate std.error statistic p.value\n#>   <chr>            <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>\n#> 1 (Intercept)      9.77     0.252       38.7       0\n#> 2 log_dist2road   -0.563    0.0201     -28.0       0\n\nWe tidy the spatial covariance parameters by running\n\ntidy(spmod, effects = \"spcov\")\n#> # A tibble: 3 × 3\n#>   term   estimate is_known\n#>   <chr>     <dbl> <lgl>   \n#> 1 de       0.360  FALSE   \n#> 2 ie       0.0790 FALSE   \n#> 3 range 8237.     FALSE\n\nThe is_known column indicates whether the parameter is assumed known. By default, all parameters are assumed unknown. We discuss this more in Chapter 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAnother data set contained within the spmodel package is the caribou data set. Read about the caribou data with ?caribou. Then, fit a spatial linear model with\n\n\nz as the response and tarp, water, and the interaction between tarp and water as predictors\na spatial covariance model for the errors of your choosing. You can examine the spatial covariance models available to use in the spcov_type argument of splm() in the Arguments section of ?splm.\n\nx as the xcoord and y as the ycoord (note that the xcoord and ycoord arguments now need to be specified because caribou is a data.frame object, not an sf object).\n\nAfter fitting the model, perform an analysis of variance using anova() to assess the importance of tarp, water, and tarp:water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncaribou_mod <- splm(z ~ tarp + water + tarp:water,\n                    data = caribou, spcov_type = \"pexponential\",\n                    xcoord = x, ycoord = y)\nsummary(caribou_mod)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> splm(formula = z ~ tarp + water + tarp:water, data = caribou, \n#>     spcov_type = \"pexponential\", xcoord = x, ycoord = y)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n#> -0.35291 -0.20863 -0.14249 -0.01117  0.38358 \n#> \n#> Coefficients (fixed):\n#>                  Estimate Std.

Additionally, model diagnostics such as leverage, fitted values, residuals (several types), and Cook’s distance. While both the model fit statistics and the diagnostics can be found with individual functions like AIC(), residuals(), cooks.distance(), etc., they can also be computed using glance() (for the model fit statistics) and augment() (for the diagnostics).\n\nglance(spmod)\n#> # A tibble: 1 × 9\n#>       n     p  npar value   AIC  AICc logLik deviance pseudo.r.squared\n#>   <int> <dbl> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>            <dbl>\n#> 1   365     2     3  367.  373.  373.  -184.     363.            0.683\n\nThe output from glance() shows model fit statistics for the spatial linear model with an exponential covariance structure for the errors.\nThe augment() function provides many model diagnostics statistics in a single tibble:\n\naugment(spmod)\n#> Simple feature collection with 365 features and 7 fields\n#> Geometry type: POINT\n#> Dimension:     XY\n#> Bounding box:  xmin: -445884.1 ymin: 1929616 xmax: -383656.8 ymax: 2061414\n#> Projected CRS: NAD83 / Alaska Albers\n#> # A tibble: 365 × 8\n#>    log_Zn log_dist2road .fitted .resid   .hat .cooksd .std.resid\n#>  *  <dbl>         <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>      <dbl>\n#>  1   7.33          2.68    8.26 -0.928 0.0200 0.0142       1.18 \n#>  2   7.38          2.68    8.26 -0.880 0.0200 0.0186       1.35 \n#>  3   7.58          2.54    8.34 -0.755 0.0225 0.00482      0.647\n#>  4   7.63          2.97    8.09 -0.464 0.0197 0.0305       1.74 \n#>  5   7.26          2.72    8.24 -0.977 0.0215 0.131        3.45 \n#>  6   7.65          2.76    8.21 -0.568 0.0284 0.0521       1.89 \n#>  7   7.59          2.30    8.47 -0.886 0.0300 0.0591       1.96 \n#>  8   7.16          2.78    8.20 -1.05  0.0335 0.00334      0.439\n#>  9   7.19          2.93    8.12 -0.926 0.0378 0.0309       1.26 \n#> 10   8.07          2.79    8.20 -0.123 0.0314 0.00847      0.723\n#> # ℹ 355 more rows\n#> # ℹ 1 more variable: geometry <POINT [m]>\n\naugment() returns a tibble with many model diagnostics statistics, including\n\n\n.fitted, the fitted value, calculated from the estimated fixed effects in the model\n\n.hat, the Mahalanobis distance, a metric of leverage\n\n.cooksd, the Cook’s distance, a metric of influence\n\n.std.resid, the standardized residual\n\nIf the model is correct, then the standardized residuals have mean 0, standard deviation 1, and are uncorrelated.\nThe plot() function can be used on a fitted model object to construct a few pre-specified plots of these model diagnostics. For example, the following code plots the Cook’s distance, a measure of influence, which quantifies each observation’s impact on model fit:\n\nplot(spmod, which = 4)\n\n\n\n\nThe other 7 plots for model objects fit with splm() can be read about in the help: ?plot.spmodel.\nIf the grammar of graphics plotting syntax in ggplot2 is more familiar, then we can also construct plots with the augmented model:\n\naug_df <- augment(spmod)\nggplot(data = aug_df, aes(x = seq_len(nrow(aug_df)), y = .cooksd)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Row Number\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nUse spmodel’s plot function on the spmod object to construct a plot of the fitted spatial covariance vs spatial distance.

We fit a nonspatial linear model using splm() with spcov_type = \"none\" (this is equivalent to a model fit using lm(), but using splm() provides access to other helper functions in spmodel):\n\nnone <- splm(formula = log_Zn ~ log_dist2road, data = moss,\n              spcov_type = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCompare the output of the none model fit using splm() to a model via using lm(). Do you get the same estimates and standard errors?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(none)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> splm(formula = log_Zn ~ log_dist2road, data = moss, spcov_type = \"none\")\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n#> -1.45814 -0.37942 -0.05889  0.38035  1.77185 \n#> \n#> Coefficients (fixed):\n#>               Estimate Std.

For small sample sizes, the p-values may be slightly different because spmodel uses a reference z-distribution while lm() uses a reference t-distribution.\n\n\n\nThe glances() function allows us to compare the model fit statistics for a few different models simultaneously. Two of these fit statistics are AIC and AICc (Akaike 1974), which are commonly used to select a “best” model – the lower the AIC/AICc, the better the model. The AICc is more appropriate for small samples, but for large samples AIC/AICc are nearly equivalent. glances() automatically orders the models by AICc:\n\nglances(spmod, none)\n#> # A tibble: 2 × 10\n#>   model     n     p  npar value   AIC  AICc logLik deviance pseudo.r.squared\n#>   <chr> <int> <dbl> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>            <dbl>\n#> 1 spmod   365     2     3  367.  373.  373.  -184.     363.            0.683\n#> 2 none    365     2     1  634.  636.  636.  -317.     363.            0.671\n\nThe AIC and AICc are significantly lower for the spatial model, which suggest the spatial model fits the data better than the nonspatial model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe default estimation method is restricted maximum likelihood (estmethod = \"reml\"). Models fit using REML can only be compared using AIC/AICc when the models have the same set of explanatory variables. Models with different sets of explanatory variables can be compared via AIC/AICc when fitting using maximum likelihood (estmethod = \"ml\"). AIC/AICc are not defined for models fit using estmethod = \"sv-wls\" or estmethod = \"sv-cl\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nUse the likelihood ratio test (run help(\"anova.spmod\", \"spmodel\")) to determine whether the spatial model outperforms the nonspatial model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe likelihood ratio test can be used here because 1) the models are “nested” within one another (i.e., the nonspatial linear model is a special case of the spatial linear model with de set to zero) and 2) because estmethod = \"reml\", the fixed effect structure is the same (like AIC/AICc, to compare models with varying fixed effect structures, use estmethod = \"ml\").\n\nanova(spmod, none)\n#> Likelihood Ratio Test\n#> \n#> Response: log_Zn\n#>               Df   Chi2 Pr(>Chi2)    \n#> spmod vs none  2 266.85 < 2.2e-16 ***\n#> ---\n#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nThe small p-value (\\(p < 0.001\\)) indicates that the spatial model is a significantly better fit to the data.\n\n\n\nAnother approach to model selection is leave-one-out cross validation (Hastie et al. 2009). In leave-one-out cross validation, a single observation is removed from the data, the model is re-fit, and a prediction is made for the held-out observation. Then, a loss metric like mean-squared-prediction error (MSPE) is computed and used to evaluate model fit. The lower the mean-squared-prediction error, the better the model fit.\n\nloocv(spmod)\n#> # A tibble: 1 × 4\n#>      bias  MSPE RMSPE  cor2\n#>     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n#> 1 0.00655 0.111 0.333 0.886\nloocv(none)\n#> # A tibble: 1 × 4\n#>       bias  MSPE RMSPE  cor2\n#>      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n#> 1 0.000644 0.324 0.569 0.667\n\nloocv() returns several useful fit statistics:\n\n\nbias: The average difference between the observed value and its leave-one-out prediction. This should be close to zero for well-fitting models.\n\nMSPE: The mean squared prediction error between the observed value and its leave-one-out prediction.\n\nRMSPE: The square root of MSPE.\n\ncor2: The squared correlation between the observed value and its leave-one-out prediction. This can be viewed as a “predictive” R-squared, emulating the “squared correlation” interpretation of R-squared in nonspatial linear models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWe do not recommend using pseudo R-squared as a criteria by which to compare models, as it is simply a descriptive statistic that provides insight model fit. The “predictive” R-squared statistic (cor2 in loocv()) is a type of R-squared statistic that can be compared across models.Instead, consider the cor2 statistic, which is a type of R-squared statistic that is generally comparable across models.\n\n\n\n1.2.4.1 Some Model Selection Strategies\nTEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT"

    "text": "1.3 Spatial Prediction\n\n1.3.1 Data Introduction\nThe moose data in the spmodel package contains observations from a moose survey in Alaska. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game performed the survey on 218 spatial locations throughout the region of interest. Our goal is to predict the moose count in 100 spatial locations in the moose_pred data frame that were not surveyed. Both elev, the elevation of the spatial location, and strat, a stratification variable based on landscape metrics that is either \"L\" for Low or \"M\" for medium, are possible predictors for moose count.\n\nmoose\n#> Simple feature collection with 218 features and 4 fields\n#> Geometry type: POINT\n#> Dimension:     XY\n#> Bounding box:  xmin: 269085 ymin: 1416151 xmax: 419976.2 ymax: 1541763\n#> Projected CRS: NAD83 / Alaska Albers\n#> First 10 features:\n#>        elev strat count presence                 geometry\n#> 1  468.9167     L     0        0 POINT (293542.6 1541016)\n#> 2  362.3125     L     0        0 POINT (298313.1 1533972)\n#> 3  172.7500     M     0        0 POINT (281896.4 1532516)\n#> 4  279.6250     L     0        0 POINT (298651.3 1530264)\n#> 5  619.6000     L     0        0 POINT (311325.3 1527705)\n#> 6  164.1250     M     0        0 POINT (291421.5 1518398)\n#> 7  163.5000     M     0        0 POINT (287298.3 1518035)\n#> 8  186.3500     L     0        0 POINT (279050.9 1517324)\n#> 9  362.3125     L     0        0 POINT (346145.9 1512479)\n#> 10 430.5000     L     0        0 POINT (321354.6 1509966)\n\nWe visualize the moose counts by running\n\nggplot(data = moose, aes(colour = count)) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_colour_viridis_c(limits = c(0, 40)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFrom our plot, we see that there are a large number of observed moose counts at or near 0. Therefore, perhaps a generalized linear model in the Poisson or negative binomial family might be more appropriate for this particular data set. We will come back to this issue in Chapter 3; however, for this section, we assume that a standard spatial linear model is appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe also see in the plot that the spatial locations in the survey were clearly not randomly selected. Random selection of spatial locations is only required for inference in design-based analyses. For model-based analyses, random selection of spatial locations is not necessarily an assumption (Brus (2021); Dumelle et al. (2022)).\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Moose Count Predictions\nIn this section, we show how to use predict() and augment() to perform spatial prediction (also called Kriging) for point-referenced data from a model fit with splm(). First, we fit a spatial model to the moose data with a \"spherical\" spatial covariance and elev, strat, and their interaction as predictors in the model:\n\nmoosemod <- splm(count ~ elev * strat, data = moose,\n                  spcov_type = \"spherical\")\ntidy(moosemod)\n#> # A tibble: 4 × 5\n#>   term        estimate std.error statistic p.value\n#>   <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>\n#> 1 (Intercept)   0.310    9.02       0.0344 0.973  \n#> 2 elev          0.0141   0.00806    1.76   0.0792 \n#> 3 stratM        6.93     2.26       3.07   0.00217\n#> 4 elev:stratM  -0.0273   0.0130    -2.10   0.0357\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nelev * strat is shorthand for elev + strat + elev:strat.\n\n\nWe then use predict() to predict the moose count at the spatial locations in moose_preds. The predict() function for models fit with splm() works in the same way as it does for models fit with lm(). We provide predict() with the fitted model object, along with a newdata argument that is an sf object, data.frame, or tibble that contains the locations at which to predict. newdata must have the same predictors as those used to fit the spatial model. We see that moose_preds contains the predictors (elev and strat) and the locations at which to predict:\n\nmoose_preds\n#> Simple feature collection with 100 features and 2 fields\n#> Geometry type: POINT\n#> Dimension:     XY\n#> Bounding box:  xmin: 269085 ymin: 1416151 xmax: 419976.2 ymax: 1541763\n#> Projected CRS: NAD83 / Alaska Albers\n#> First 10 features:\n#>        elev strat                 geometry\n#> 1  143.4000     L POINT (401239.6 1436192)\n#> 2  324.4375     L POINT (352640.6 1490695)\n#> 3  158.2632     L POINT (360954.9 1491590)\n#> 4  221.3125     M POINT (291839.8 1466091)\n#> 5  208.6875     M POINT (310991.9 1441630)\n#> 6  218.3333     L POINT (304473.8 1512103)\n#> 7  126.8125     L POINT (339011.1 1459318)\n#> 8  122.0833     L POINT (342827.3 1463452)\n#> 9  191.0000     L POINT (284453.8 1502837)\n#> 10 105.3125     L POINT (391343.9 1483791)\n\n\n# results omitted\npredict(moosemod, newdata = moose_preds)\n\nThe output of predict() (not rendered in this document) gives predicted moose counts for the 100 unobserved spatial locations in moose_preds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExamining some of the predictions, we see that a few are negative. These unreasonable negative values are a further indication that we should use a spatial generalized linear model in Chapter 3.\n\n\nThe augment() function can also be used to obtain predictions for unobserved locations. While the required arguments to augment() are the same as the arguments used in predict() (the name of the fitted model object along with a newdata data frame), the output of augment() is an sf object with predictions in the .fitted column. Often, using augment() is more convenient than using predict(), as augment() returns an object with predictions alongside the spatial locations and any predictors used in the model.\n\nmoose_aug <- augment(moosemod, newdata = moose_preds)\nmoose_aug\n#> Simple feature collection with 100 features and 3 fields\n#> Geometry type: POINT\n#> Dimension:     XY\n#> Bounding box:  xmin: 269386.2 ymin: 1418453 xmax: 419976.2 ymax: 1541763\n#> Projected CRS: NAD83 / Alaska Albers\n#> # A tibble: 100 × 4\n#>     elev strat .fitted           geometry\n#>  * <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>        <POINT [m]>\n#>  1  143.

    "text": "2.1 Big Spatial Data\nFor large observed data sets, fitting spatial linear models or making predictions is challenging because these operations require products that involve \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\), which are computationally challenging to obtain. Typically, samples sizes approaching around 10,000 make model fitting or prediction infeasible on a standard computer in a reasonable amount of time (your definition of this may vary). This necessitates the use of model fitting and prediction tools that work for large data sets. spmodel offers big data methods for model fitting and prediction for point-referenced data via the local argument to splm() and predict().\n\n2.1.1 Model Fitting\nspmodel implements “local” spatial indexing as described by Ver Hoef et al. (2023). Observations are first assigned an index. Then for the purposes of model fitting, observations with different indexes are assumed uncorrelated. Assuming observations with different indexes are uncorrelated induces sparsity in the covariance matrix, which greatly reduces the computational time required for operations that involve \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\). Models fit using spatial indexing are capable of fitting models with hundreds of thousands of observations relatively quickly. Ver Hoef et al. (2023) showed that in a variety of scenarios, spatial indexing yielded fixed effect confidence intervals with proper coverage.\nTo illustrate spatial indexing in spmodel, we first simulate a response variable sim_response with 5000 observations at random spatial locations in the unit square (sim_coords). Then we place the response and coordinates in a data.frame:\n\nset.seed(18072023)\nsim_params <- spcov_params(\"exponential\", de = 7, ie = 2, range = 0.7)\n\nn <- 5000\nx <- runif(n)\ny <- runif(n)\nsim_coords <- data.frame(x, y)\n\nsim_response <- sprnorm(sim_params, data = sim_coords,\n                        xcoord = x, ycoord = y)\nsim_data <- data.frame(sim_coords, sim_response)\n\nWe visualize the data by running\n\nggplot(sim_data, aes(x = x, y = y, color = sim_response)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(-12, 6)) +\n  theme_gray(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Distribution of simulated data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe provide more detail regarding using spmodel to simulate data later on in this section.\n\n\nWe then use splm() to fit a spatial model to sim_data, providing the xcoord and ycoord arguments because sim_data is a data.frame, not an sf object. To implement spatial indexing, we use the local argument to splm(). Setting local to TRUE chooses default spatial indexing settings. We fit the model and time it by running\n\nfit_start_time <- proc.time()\nbdmod <- splm(sim_response ~ 1, data = sim_data,\n     spcov_type = \"exponential\",\n     xcoord = x, ycoord = y,\n     local = TRUE)\nfit_end_time <- proc.time()\nfit_end_time - fit_start_time\n#>    user  system elapsed \n#>    6.40    1.00    8.11\n\nThe model with 5000 observations is fit in just 8.11 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen the sample size is larger than 5000 observations, splm() implements spatial indexing by default, as fitting time without spatial indexing becomes lengthy. This behavior can be overridden by explicitly setting local to FALSE.\n\n\nA summary of the model fit yields\n\nsummary(bdmod)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> splm(formula = sim_response ~ 1, data = sim_data, spcov_type = \"exponential\", \n#>     xcoord = x, ycoord = y, local = TRUE)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n#> -8.1637 -2.1133 -0.1934  1.8122  9.1225 \n#> \n#> Coefficients (fixed):\n#>             Estimate Std.

To learn more, read about local in splm()’s help page by running ?splm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEven for two separate data sets with the same sample size fit on the same machine, the computational time required to fit models via spatial indexing varies, depending on many factors like the number of iterations required for convergence and the number of observations assigned to each spatial index.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Local Prediction\nUsing the fitted model, Ver Hoef et al. (2023) evaluates the performance of local neighborhood prediction. Local neighborhood prediction only uses some of the observed data to predict for an unobserved location of interest. Local neighborhood prediction is capable of making predictions of hundreds of thousands of observations relatively quickly. Ver Hoef et al. (2023) showed that in a variety of scenarios, local neighborhood prediction yielded prediction intervals with proper coverage.\nTo illustrate local neighborhood prediction in spmodel, we first simulate 3000 new random spatial locations in the unit square (sim_coords). Then we place the coordinates in a data.frame and visualize:\n\nn_pred <- 3000\nx_pred <- runif(n_pred)\ny_pred <- runif(n_pred)\nsim_preds <- tibble::tibble(x = x_pred, y = y_pred)\n\nTo implement local neighborhood prediction, we use the local argument to predict() (or augment()). Setting local in predict() (or augment()) to TRUE chooses default local neighborhood prediction settings. We compute local neighborhood predictions at the unobserved locations in sim_preds and time it by running\n\npred_start_time <- proc.time()\nsim_preds$preds <- predict(bdmod, newdata = sim_preds, local = TRUE)\npred_end_time <- proc.time()\npred_end_time - pred_start_time\n#>    user  system elapsed \n#>   15.08    1.16   19.52\n\nThe 3000 predictions are computed in just 19.52 seconds. We visualize them by running\n\nggplot(sim_preds, aes(x = x, y = y, color = preds)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(-12, 6)) +\n  theme_gray(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Distribution of local neighborhood predictions using the model fit to the large simulated data set.\n\n\n\n\nThese predictions at the unobserved locations closely match the pattern of the observed data.\nThe other way to specify local in predict() (or augment()) is via a list object, which offers much more control and customization over the local neighborhood prediction. To learn more, read about local in predict()’s (or augment()’s) help page by running ?predict.spmodel (or ?augment.spmodel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nloocv() also has a local argument for large data sets that is structured the same as local for predict() (and augment())."

Spatial covariance is isotropic if it behaves similarly in all directions. A spatial covariance is (geometrically) anisotropic if it does not behave similarly in all directions. Anisotropic models require estimation of two additional parameters: rotate and scale, which control the behavior of the spatial covariance as a function of distance and direction.\n\naniso <- splm(log_Zn ~ log_dist2road,\n              data = moss, spcov_type = \"exponential\",\n              anisotropy = TRUE)\naniso\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> splm(formula = log_Zn ~ log_dist2road, data = moss, spcov_type = \"exponential\", \n#>     anisotropy = TRUE)\n#> \n#> \n#> Coefficients (fixed):\n#>   (Intercept)  log_dist2road  \n#>         9.548         -0.546  \n#> \n#> \n#> Coefficients (exponential spatial covariance):\n#>        de         ie      range     rotate      scale  \n#> 3.561e-01  6.812e-02  8.732e+03  2.435e+00  4.753e-01\n\nWe can again use glances to compare the model that allows for anisotropy with the isotropic model:\n\nglances(spmod, aniso)\n#> # A tibble: 2 × 10\n#>   model     n     p  npar value   AIC  AICc logLik deviance pseudo.r.squared\n#>   <chr> <int> <dbl> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>            <dbl>\n#> 1 aniso   365     2     5  362.  372.  372.  -181.     363             0.705\n#> 2 spmod   365     2     3  367.  373.  373.  -184.     363.            0.683\n\nThe anisotropic model does have lower AIC and AICc than the isotropic model, indicating a better fit. However, the reduction in AIC and AICc is quite small, so we may still prefer the isotropic model for simplicity and interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nVisualize the anisotropic level curve for aniso using plot(). Hint: Run ?plot.spmodel or visit this link. Which direction does the model predict two responses will be more correlated?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(aniso, which = 8)\n\n\n\n\nA clockwise rotation of this level curve by rotate followed by a scaling of the minor axis by the reciprocal of scale yields a spatial covariance that is isotropic.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Partition Factors\nA partition factor is a categorical (or factor) variable that forces observations in different levels of the partition factor to be uncorrelated. The year variable in moss has two levels, 2001 and 2006, which correspond to the year of measurement. Suppose the goal is to fit a model that assumes observations from the same year are spatially correlated but observations from different years are not spatially correlated. In this context, year is a partition factor. We fit this model by running\n\npart <- splm(log_Zn ~ log_dist2road,\n             data = moss, spcov_type = \"exponential\",\n             partition_factor = ~ year)\n\nLike the formula and random arguments, the partition_factor argument requires a formula object.\n\n2.2.5 Fixing Covariance Parameters\nBy default, splm() estimates all unknown covariance parameters. However, we can also fix covariance parameters at known values with the spcov_initial argument for spatial covariance parameters and with the randcov_initial argument for non-spatial covariance parameters.\nAs an example, suppose that we want to fit a \"spherical\" covariance model to the moss data, but that, we want to fix the range at 20000 units so that errors from spatial locations more than 20000 units apart are not spatially correlated. We first create an spcov_initial object with the spcov_initial() function:\n\ninit_spher <- spcov_initial(\"spherical\", range = 20000, known = \"range\")\ninit_spher\n#> $initial\n#> range \n#> 20000 \n#> \n#> $is_known\n#> range \n#>  TRUE \n#> \n#> attr(,\"class\")\n#> [1] \"spherical\"\n\nWithin the function call, we specify that, for a \"spherical\" covariance, we would like to set the range parameter to 20000 and for that value to be known and therefore fixed in any subsequent estimation.

The random forest spatial residual model available in spmodel combines random forest modeling and spatial linear models. First, the model is fit using random forests and fitted values are obtained. Then the response residuals are used to fit a spatial linear model. Predictions at unobserved locations are computed as the sum of the random forest prediction and the predicted (i.e., Kriged) response residual from the spatial linear model. Suppose we split the moss data into training and test data sets, with the goal of predicting log_Zn in the test data.\n\nset.seed(1)\nn <- NROW(moss)\nn_train <- round(0.75 * n)\nn_test <- n - n_train\ntrain_index <- sample(n, size = n_train)\nmoss_train <- moss[train_index, , ]\nmoss_test <- moss[-train_index, , ]\n\nWe fit a random forest spatial residual model to the test data by running\n\nrfsrmod <- splmRF(log_Zn ~ log_dist2road, moss_train,\n                  spcov_type = \"exponential\")\n\nWe make predictions for the test data by running\n\n# results omitted\npredict(rfsrmod, moss_test)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nUse predict() to store the random forest spatial residual predictions of log_Zn at locations in the test data and then compute the mean-squared prediction error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreds <- predict(rfsrmod, newdata = moss_test)\nerrors <- moss_test$log_Zn - preds\nmean(errors^2)\n#> [1] 0.1849228"

    "text": "2.3 Areal Data\n\n2.3.1 Data Introduction\nThroughout the section, we will use the seal data in the spmodel package. The seal data is an sf object with a POLYGON geometry. There are 62 polygons in the data, some of which have non-missing values of log_trend, which is the log of the estimated harbor-seal trends that were calculated from abundance data.\nThe following code generates a visualization of the seal data: polygons that are grey have a missing value for log_trend.\n\nggplot(seal, aes(fill = log_trend)) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 14) \n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to fit a spatial autoregressive model (Equation 1.4 and Equation 1.6) to the log_trend response variable with the spautor() function. Then, we will use the fitted model to predict the log_trend for sites where log_trend is not recorded.\n\n2.3.2 spautor() Syntax and Output Interpretation\nThe syntax for fitting a model to areal data with spautor() is very similar to that used for splm(). Again, there are generally at least three required arguments:\n\n\nformula: a formula that describes the relationship between the response variable (\\(\\mathbf{y}\\)) and explanatory variables (\\(\\mathbf{X}\\))\n\n\nformula in spautor() is the same as formula in lm() and splm()\n\n\n\n\ndata: a data.frame or sf object that contains the response variable, explanatory variables, and spatial information. Note that if data is a data.frame, then W is an additional required argument to spautor().\n\nspcov_type: the spatial covariance type (\"car\" or \"sar\")\n\nWe can fit a conditional auto-regressive (CAR) model with\n\nsealmod <- spautor(log_trend ~ 1, data = seal, spcov_type = \"car\")\nsummary(sealmod)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> spautor(formula = log_trend ~ 1, data = seal, spcov_type = \"car\")\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n#> -0.34455 -0.10417  0.04410  0.07338  0.20475 \n#> \n#> Coefficients (fixed):\n#>             Estimate Std.

Recall that observations are not considered neighbors with themselves. Also by default, spautor() row standardizes the weight matrix so that each of the rows in \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) sum to \\(1\\). Row standardization of the weight matrix is performed by default because doing so results in “nice” properties of the resulting covariance matrix (ver2018spatial?). The first row of the weight matrix is\n\nsealmod$W[1, ]\n#>  [1] 0.0000000 0.3333333 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#>  [8] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [15] 0.0000000 0.3333333 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [22] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.3333333\n#> [29] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [36] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [43] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [50] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [57] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n\nThe output indicates that the first observation is neighbors with the second observation, the sixteenth observation, and the twenty-eighth observation.\nFinally, if we re-examine \\(\\mathbf{W}\\), we can note that some rows of \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) do not have any positive values, indicating that some observations in the data have no neighbors. Looking back on the plot of the data, we see that there are indeed a few “island” sites that do not share a boundary with any other polygons. The errors for these spatial locations are assumed to be uncorrelated with all other random errors, and, they are given a unique variance parameter that is the extra spatial covariance estimate in the summary output of the model.\n\n2.3.3 Additional Analysis\nMost of the helper functions for models fit with splm() are also useful for models fit with spautor(). Additionally, most of the additional arguments for splm() are also additional arguments for spautor().\nOf the functions mentioned in ?sec-model-fitting, the following are also available to use on a model fit with spautor():\n\n\naugment(), glance(), and glances()\n\nmodel fit statistics with AIC(), AICc() and GR2()\n\nmodel diagnostics statistics with cooks.distance(), residuals(), fitted(), etc.\n\nOf the arguments mentioned in ?sec-model-fitting, spcov_initial and random are available for spautor().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe anisotropy argument is not available for spautor() because the covariance for an autoregressive model is based on the neighborhood structure of the spatial locations, not on distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nChoose a couple of the helper functions that you would like to explore and apply those functions to the fitted seal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAIC(sealmod)\n#> [1] -30.87584\nfitted(sealmod)\n#>           2           3           4           5           6           7 \n#> -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 \n#>           8          10          11          12          14          16 \n#> -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 \n#>          17          20          21          22          23          24 \n#> -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 \n#>          25          26          28          29          30          31 \n#> -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 \n#>          33          34          35          37          38          39 \n#> -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 \n#>          41          45          59          60 \n#> -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121 -0.07090121\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Prediction with Areal Data\nPrediction of response values for unobserved polygons with areal data requires that the polygons with missing response values be included in the data argument supplied to spautor(). The reason for this requirement is that exclusion of these polygons changes the underlying neighborhood structure of the data, and, therefore changes the covariance matrix.\nFor areal data, we can obtain predictions for unobserved polygons using predict() on the fitted model object or augment() on the fitted model object, specifying the newdata argument to be mod$newdata. Both approaches are given below:\n\nsealmod <- spautor(log_trend ~ 1, data = seal, spcov_type = \"car\")\nsummary(sealmod)\n\npredict(sealmod)\n\n\naugment(sealmod, newdata = sealmod$newdata)\n#> Simple feature collection with 28 features and 2 fields\n#> Geometry type: POLYGON\n#> Dimension:     XY\n#> Bounding box:  xmin: 913618.8 ymin: 1007542 xmax: 1115097 ymax: 1132682\n#> Projected CRS: NAD83 / Alaska Albers\n#> # A tibble: 28 × 3\n#>    log_trend  .fitted                                                geometry\n#>  *     <dbl>    <dbl>                                           <POLYGON [m]>\n#>  1        NA -0.115   ((1035002 1054710, 1035002 1054542, 1035002 1053542, 1…\n#>  2        NA -0.00908 ((1043093 1020553, 1043097 1020550, 1043101 1020550, 1…\n#>  3        NA -0.0602  ((1099737 1054310, 1099752 1054262, 1099788 1054278, 1…\n#>  4        NA -0.0359  ((1099002 1036542, 1099134 1036462, 1099139 1036431, 1…\n#>  5        NA -0.0723  ((1076902 1053189, 1076912 1053179, 1076931 1053179, 1…\n#>  6        NA -0.0548  ((1070501 1046969, 1070317 1046598, 1070308 1046542, 1…\n#>  7        NA -0.0976  ((1072995 1054942, 1072996 1054910, 1072997 1054878, 1…\n#>  8        NA -0.0714  ((960001.5 1127667, 960110.8 1127542, 960144.1 1127495…\n#>  9        NA -0.0825  ((1031308 1079817, 1031293 1079754, 1031289 1079741, 1…\n#> 10        NA -0.0592  ((998923.7 1053647, 998922.5 1053609, 998950 1053631, …\n#> # ℹ 18 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe mod$newdata syntax also works for models fit with splm(), where the data used contains missing values for the response variable at any unobserved locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nVerify that the fitted autoregressive model with the seal data changes when the polygons with missing response values are excluded from the data argument in spautor().

Similarly, we can formulate spatial generalized autoregressive models using spgautor(), building off the construction of spatial autoregressive models fit using spautor(). Spatial generalized autoregressive models can be fit to binomial, proportion, count, and skewed data by providing the family argument, as with the models fit using spglm() in Chapter 3. For example, we model exp(log_trend) (which is strictly positive) as a gamma random variable with the simultaneous autoregressive spatial covariance by running\n\nsealgmod <- spgautor(exp(log_trend) ~ 1, family = Gamma,\n                  data = seal, spcov_type = \"sar\")\nsummary(sealgmod)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> spgautor(formula = exp(log_trend) ~ 1, family = Gamma, data = seal, \n#>     spcov_type = \"sar\")\n#> \n#> Deviance Residuals:\n#>      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n#> -0.31970 -0.10003  0.04354  0.07266  0.20661 \n#> \n#> Coefficients (fixed):\n#>             Estimate Std.

It is often useful to simulate spatial data with “known” spatial covariance parameters and study the suitability of models fit to these data.\n\n2.4.1 Simulating Spatial Gaussian Data\nWe simulate Gaussian spatial data using sprnorm(). sprnorm() is similar in structure to rnorm() for simulating non-spatial Gaussian data. The first argument to sprnorm() is spcov_params, which is a spatial covariance parameter object created with spcov_params():\n\nparams <- spcov_params(\"exponential\", de = 1, ie = 0.5, range = 5e5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen the type argument to coef() is \"spcov\", the estimated spatial covariance parameters are returned as an spcov_params object, naturally usable simulation-based contexts that require conditioning on these estimated parameters.\n\n\nsprnorm() simulates data at each location in data for each of n samples (specified via n) with some mean vector (specified via mean). We simulate one realization of zero-mean Gaussian data with spatial covariance structure from params at each location in the sulfate data by running\n\nset.seed(1)\nsulfate$z <- sprnorm(params, data = sulfate)\n\nWe visualize this realization by running\n\nggplot(sulfate, aes(color = z)) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  theme_gray(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\nWe visualize an empirical semivariogram of this realization by running\n\nesv_out <- esv(z ~ 1, sulfate)\nggplot(esv_out, aes(x = dist, y = gamma, size = np)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  lims(y = c(0, NA)) +\n  theme_gray(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSimulating spatial data in spmodel requires the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix, which can take awhile for sample sizes exceeding 10,000. Regardless of the number of realizations simulated, this Cholesky decompsition is only needed once, which means that simulating many realizations (via samples) takes nearly the same time as simulating just one."
