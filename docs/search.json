While GIS functionality in R was originally handled with the sp, rgdal, rgeos packages for vector data and the raster package for rasterized data, much of this work as moved to the sf package for vector data and terra or stars packages for rasters. We’ll be using sfand terra during the workshop."

    "text": "1.3 Preliminaries\n\n1.3.1 Install R\nPrior to the start of the workshop everyone will need to have the software installed and tested. You will need to have R, Rtools, and RStudio. Please get at least R version &gt; 4.0 and the compatible version of R tools: R CRAN.Rtools will be necessary to install non-CRAN repositories from GitHub (see below).\n\n1.3.2 Install RStudio\nPlease also make sure you have a version of Posit’s RStudio installed that is compatible with your version of R/Rtools: RStudio.\n\n1.3.3 Install R Packages\nCommon Packages\nFirst, we need to install several R packages. R operates on user-contributed packages, and we’ll be using several of these in this workshop. We will use several packages that are core to data management in R: tidyverse, ggplot2, data.table.\nIf you haven’t done so already for these packages, please run these lines of code:\n\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\ninstall.packages('ggplot2')\ninstall.packages('data.table')\n\nGeospatial Packages\nIn addition to these core packages, we’ll be using several CRAN packages specifically developed for GIS tasks or handling/obtaining spatial data:\n\n\nsf - The Simple Features package is for working with vector data (points, lines, polygons).\n\nterra - The Terra package handles raster data.\n\nprism - PRISM facilitates the download and extraction of Oregon State University’s PRISM climate data.\n\ntigris - Census TIGER/Line package for accessing political boundaries of the U.S.\n\nnhdplusTools - nhdplusTools is a package for navigating and extracting data from the medium resolution NHDPlus.\n\nWe’ll also need a couple of packages to handle watershed delineation from a USGS API:\n\njsonlite - jsonlite package for parsing results from API queries.\ngeojson - geojson package for parsing geographic json results.\nmapview - mapview is a package for quickly making interactive maps in R, but especially useful within RMarkdown or Quarto documents.\n\n\ninstall.packages('sf')\ninstall.packages('terra')\ninstall.packages('prism')\ninstall.packages('tigris')\ninstall.packages('nhdplusTools')\ninstall.packages('jsonlite')\ninstall.packages('geojson')\ninstall.packages('mapview')\ninstall.packages('FedData')\ninstall.packages('tidyterra')\n\nNew EPA Packages\nFinally, we will use three new packages developed by researchers at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. These packages will need to installed from GitHub:\n\n\nFigure 1.2: spmodel hex sticker.\n\nspmodel - The spmodel package is the basis of this workshop. Although this package is available on the CRAN, we will use the version from GitHub with the latest updates.\n\n\nFigure 1.3: StreamCatTools hex sticker.\n\nStreamCatTools - The StreamCatTools package retrieves StreamCat and LakeCat data via an API.\n\n\nFigure 1.4: finsyncR hex sticker.\n\nfinsyncR - The finsyncR package greatly facilitates the retrieval and harmonization of EPA and USGS stream macroinvertebrate and fish data.\nTo install these packages:\n\n# spmodel from CRAN\ninstall.packages('spmodel')\n# Packages from GitHub\ninstall.packages('remotes')\nremotes::install_github(\"USEPA/finsyncR\", build_vignette = TRUE)\nremotes::install_github(\"USEPA/StreamCatTools\", build_vignettes = FALSE)"
